# Unity-2D-Player-Controller

Hello, this player controller with custom physics was created as a portfolio to get into the game industry. You are free to use this code as you wish. Props to Sebastian Lague and Tarodev, as they inspired me to do this project.

This script is not finished and will receive updates, thus making the feedback from you guys important!

## Controlls
Move Left: Left Arrow

Move Right: Right Arrow

Jump: C

Grab: Z

## Important
To make the controller work, you have to install a new Input system! You can install it in the package manager window (Window >> Package Manager).
If you are adding script to player, don't forget to set up layer masks.

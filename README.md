# Unity-2D-Player-Controller

Hello, this player controller with custom physics was created as a portfolio to get into the game industry. You are free to use this code as you wish. Props to Sebastian Lague and Tarodev, as they inspired me to do this project.

This script is not finished and will receive updates!!!

You can use the scripts as you want!

# Important
To make the controller work, you have to install a new Input system! You can install it in the package manager window (Window >> Package Manager).
